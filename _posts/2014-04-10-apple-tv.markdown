Today, I bought apple tv.
I almost like it.
However, I think there are few points of improvemnt about it.

* iPad app "Remote" is only for itunes library,
  it should support third party app (hulu).
* Many app doesn't auto play.
* we can't develop apple tv application
* input with remote control is very disgusting.
